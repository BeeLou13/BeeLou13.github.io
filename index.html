As I embark on the exciting journey of launching my career in the tech world, I bring with me a diverse skill set that includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, MySQL, and C++.

                    This website marks my debut in web development, where I've employed fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Its primary purpose is to showcase my portfolio of projects. Throughout the development journey, I also gained proficiency in jQuery and IntersectionObserver to enhance the user experience.

                    <p>
                        I followed a comprehensive tutorial that guided me through the creation of a top-down game using the Pygame library. 
                        This hands-on experience has provided me with a wealth of knowledge and insights into the world of game development.
                        This is code from the Clear Code youtuber tutorial on how to make a zelda like game using pygame.

                My name is Brenden Louis, a 20-year-old African American and I'm trying to become a software engineer.
                I've been captivated by technology for as long as I can remember, and my journey into the world of coding began during my high school years.
                Now, I'm wholeheartedly pursuing my dream of becoming a self taught software engineer.
                
                While many individuals opt for the traditional college route to achieve this goal.
                My brief venture into college taught me that it wasn't the right fit for me. 
                However, that experience didn't dampen my determination or passion. Instead,
                it fueled my desire to teach myself and find my own path in the world of programming.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
                On the casual side, I'm an enthusiast for video games, hitting the gym, diving into manga, and I'm always up for trying new experiences.
                Adaptability is a strong suit of mine; I can quickly pivot and tackle new challenges with ease.
                Collaborative by nature, I thrive in team environments and am known for my easygoing nature, making me a pleasure to work alongside.

                One unwavering quality about me is my determination; I am a very persistent person, even in the face of setbacks and failure.
